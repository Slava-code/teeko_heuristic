# teeko_heuristic
## What is the purpose of this project?
This small project is my practice with creating game heuristics. I use board observations to create a strong AI to play the game of Teeko.
If you would like to read about the rules of Teeko and see what it's like to play, here is a link: https://www.iggamecenter.com/en/rules/teeko
